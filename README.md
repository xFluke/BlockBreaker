# BlockBreaker
This is the repository for my breakout-esque game, I have yet to name the game.

Version 1.0
- Implemented basic breakout features:
  - Ball and Paddle movements
  - Bricks (Varying Health)
  - 4 Levels
- Basic Main Menu, Pause Function, Level Complete screen, Game Over Screen
- Background Music and Sound Effects
- 'Freeze' function: Holding down space holds ball in place

TO DO LIST:
- Add Documentation to Code
- Fix Pause Menu (Quit button should just lead to main menu rather than quitting application)
- Add Boss Fight mechanic
- Settings Menu (Priority: Modify volume)
- Upgrade Graphics
- Level Selection Menu
